          We were recently taking a ferry from Spain to the UK (Bilbao → Portsmouth) and decided to use this opportunity to explore the north of the Iberian Peninsula. The obvious destinations in that part of the country are cities such as San Sebastian, Bilbao or Santander and popular regions such as Asturias (with its Picos de Europa mountain range) or the Basque Country (known for their independence inclinations and a unique language).

          A short ridge with technical, enjoyable and, at times, very exposed scrambling. It features a few bolted abseils (up to 30m) and several tricky down-climbs and traverses. The difficult sections are bolted, but it&rsquo;s recommended to supplement this with own protection - 120cm slings are the most useful, a few cams and/or hexes would come handy too. A 60m rope is sufficient, but two 30m half ropes would be ideal. Overall, a great one day adventure conquering the three peaks of El Realet.

          Easy ride in a beautiful setting, featuring vineyards, olive &amp; almond trees, orange groves, charming pueblos and (most likely) great weather. Big chunk of the route follows quiet service roads and there are two short sections of gravel. Benigembla works great as a lunch break.*

          The spring of 2020 will go down in history as time of lockdowns, disease and social distance. However, in the UK, it&rsquo;s not only number of deaths that has been unusually high for this time of the year. The amount of sunshine has already surpassed any other recorded since 1929; and that&rsquo;s the state at the end of May, with good part of June (spring ends on the 20th) still left to make that number even bigger.

          Coronavirus. Much has been written on this subject in the past few months. However, many important questions still remain unanswered. How exactly does the SARS-CoV2 virus spread? Will a vaccine be invented? And if so, when? Can we avoid second waves once restrictions are lifted? How bad will the economic crisis be? Finally, could COVID-19 be a wake up call for humanity to start caring about the planet? Is it a warning that the earth is giving us?

          As most of our readers surely know, United Kingdom in not the sunniest place on the planet. Amount and frequency of rainfall differs greatly between areas, ranging from an unimpressive 580mm of average annual precipitation in London (with a little over 100 rainy days per year on average) to 3500mm (and more than 220 wet days) in a small village in Lake District. To put that in context, Rome gets on average 800mm of rainfall per year, for New York it&rsquo;s over 1100mm, Paris is 640mm, Berlin - 590mm, and finally, Barcelona - 640mm.

          If you&rsquo;ve been following our macandwentravelling blog, you would&rsquo;ve noticed it&rsquo;s been a little quiet in there since the end of 2018. With the onset of winter, weekend trips gave way to movie nights and museum visits, and there wasn&rsquo;t much to write about. Summer was short but intense, including a visit to Brazil and a road trip in Scotland (posts to come!). Then life got very busy, new job, new house, new routine - blogging took a backseat.
