      <description>We were recently taking a ferry from Spain to the UK (Bilbao → Portsmouth) and decided to use this opportunity to explore the north of the Iberian Peninsula. The obvious destinations in that part of the country are cities such as San Sebastian, Bilbao or Santander and popular regions such as Asturias (with its Picos de Europa mountain range) or the Basque Country (known for their independence inclinations and a unique language).</description>

      <description>A pleasant, hilly, 30km ride that avoids busy roads. Tyres wider than 28mm with a bit of thread recommended since route features sections of gravel. Decent views throughout.</description>

      <description>Easy ride in a beautiful setting, featuring vineyards, olive &amp;amp; almond trees, orange groves, charming pueblos and (most likely) great weather. Big chunk of the route follows quiet service roads and there are two short sections of gravel. Benigembla works great as a lunch break.*</description>

      <description>A long, sustained scramble, with beautiful views throughout. A rope is needed (ideally, a skinny 50m) for abseils, there&amp;rsquo;s one pitch of rock climbing (4+), bolted (~10 quickdraws needed). Nuts/cams not necessary. A few short, exposed sections, but mostly safe.</description>

      <description>Coronavirus. Much has been written on this subject in the past few months. However, many important questions still remain unanswered. How exactly does the SARS-CoV2 virus spread? Will a vaccine be invented? And if so, when? Can we avoid second waves once restrictions are lifted? How bad will the economic crisis be? Finally, could COVID-19 be a wake up call for humanity to start caring about the planet? Is it a warning that the earth is giving us?</description>

      <description>A moderately difficult scramble in Lake District. Suitable for scrambling beginners/novices (ideally with some rock climbing experience) who are looking to verify and improve their protection techniques. No real exposure, many escape routes and easier alternatives. Good views at the top are a reward.</description>

      <description>The spring of 2020 will go down in history as time of lockdowns, disease and social distance. However, in the UK, it&amp;rsquo;s not only number of deaths that has been unusually high for this time of the year. The amount of sunshine has already surpassed any other recorded since 1929; and that&amp;rsquo;s the state at the end of May, with good part of June (spring ends on the 20th) still left to make that number even bigger.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following our macandwentravelling blog, you would&amp;rsquo;ve noticed it&amp;rsquo;s been a little quiet in there since the end of 2018. With the onset of winter, weekend trips gave way to movie nights and museum visits, and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much to write about. Summer was short but intense, including a visit to Brazil and a road trip in Scotland (posts to come!). Then life got very busy, new job, new house, new routine - blogging took a backseat.</description>

      <title>Conquering El Realet Ridge</title>
      <link>https://macandwen.com/post/el-realet-ridge/</link>

      <description>A short ridge with technical, enjoyable and, at times, very exposed scrambling. It features a few bolted abseils (up to 30m) and several tricky down-climbs and traverses. The difficult sections are bolted, but it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to supplement this with own protection - 120cm slings are the most useful, a few cams and/or hexes would come handy too. A 60m rope is sufficient, but two 30m half ropes would be ideal. Overall, a great one day adventure conquering the three peaks of El Realet.</description>

      <description>As most of our readers surely know, United Kingdom in not the sunniest place on the planet. Amount and frequency of rainfall differs greatly between areas, ranging from an unimpressive 580mm of average annual precipitation in London (with a little over 100 rainy days per year on average) to 3500mm (and more than 220 wet days) in a small village in Lake District. To put that in context, Rome gets on average 800mm of rainfall per year, for New York it&amp;rsquo;s over 1100mm, Paris is 640mm, Berlin - 590mm, and finally, Barcelona - 640mm.</description>

      <title>10 Things To Do in Poznań</title>

      <description>To start Poznań is not Potsdam. Potsdam is in Germany and has a beautiful castle; Poznań is a Polish city located west of Warsaw. It&amp;rsquo;s a student city with very cheap Ryanair flights coming here, so perfect for a weekend escape!&#xA;1. See the Billy Goats at midday The performance lasts around 5 minutes&#xA;Every day at noon, on the east side of the main square, two billy goats emerge from behind wooden-looking door and butt each other twelve times.</description>

      <title>Top 5 Areas of the Region of Murcia</title>

      <description>The great thing about going to uni in the UK is the month-long Easter break, especially when there are no exams or deadlines on return. It allowed us to visit many different places and this year, Murcia was one of them. The main reason why we ended up there was a music festival called WAM Estrella de Levante, with Alt-J as one of the headliners. Realising that we might not get another chance to visit Murcia in foreseeable future, we decided to spend a day in this seventh largest Spanish city.</description>

      <description>Having recently visited and enjoyed Hampstead Heath (HH), we thought we&amp;rsquo;d share some photos and give you, Londoners, TEN REASONS to go there yourself.&#xA;1. Swimming We&amp;rsquo;ll start with the thing you might already be aware of - Hampstead Heath boasts three swimming ponds (female, male and mixed), which are open all year round and basically free (you’re supposed to pay, but no one bothers); they have lifeguards (well, does anyone care about that?</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;What the hell is Bannau Brycheiniog?&amp;rsquo; you&amp;rsquo;re probably wondering&amp;hellip; Well, if that&amp;rsquo;s the case, then we succeeded in drawing your attention to this post.

Bannau Brycheiniog is a Welsh name of a national park in the south of Wales, called Brecon Beacons in English. In this post, we try to convince you that it&amp;rsquo;s a nice place to go to.</description>

      <title>Backpacking from Hastings to Rye</title>

      <description>The first heat wave of 2018 stimulated us to go for our first backpacking weekend trip that year. Having very recently seen Rye ranked as one of the cutest small towns in the UK and recognising Hastings because of the 1066 battle, we thought a coastal hike from the latter to the former would make for a great weekend. And it did!&#xA;Hastings We spent most of Saturday in Hastings beaching, walking, chilling, gaming, eating and drinking beer beering.</description>

      <description>For the 2018 Spring Bank Holiday, we took off to the south of UK for some backpacking, wild camping and a bit of climbing. Our destination was the Jurassic Coast, which stretches for about 96 miles from Exmouth to Swanage and is known for its natural rock formations (such as Durdle Door), cliffs, coves and abundance of fossils. In fact, it is mainly due to that last aspect that Jurassic Coast was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2001, making it the first wholly natural World Heritage Site in the United Kingdom.</description>

      <description>This is the first post in a series about climbing, which has become our big hobby in the recent times (inspired by Alex Honnold free soloing El Capitan - google it if you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard!). After months of practice in the climbing gym, the time has come to test our skills outdoors. Having already planned a holiday on the Spanish east coast, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that Costa Blanca is also a popular destination for climbers.</description>

      <title>6 Fun Facts about Bruges</title>

      <description>Bruges (Brugge) is the capital and largest city of the province of West Flanders in the Flemish Region of Belgium (yes, their official language is Flemish [something similar to Dutch], not French! but let&amp;rsquo;s say they are not friends with neither of them historically). Its city centre is surrounded by canals protected by four town gates and it is sometimes referred to as &amp;ldquo;The Venice of the North&amp;rdquo; or even &amp;ldquo;EU&amp;rsquo;s Oxbridge&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>With the excuse of end-of-term and after successfully completing 10+ EXAMS (tough EE life), we headed to the west of UK in search of some waves.&#xA;Round train trip London Paddington to Newquay We found a nice train deal 2-weeks in advance - £22 pp round trip London Paddington to Newquay with GWR using the 16-25 young railcard (if you don&amp;rsquo;t have it yet, get it; trust me, it&amp;rsquo;s worthy! You get 1/3 off rail fares and, in addition, 34% off off-peak London tube rides when linked to your Oyster!</description>

      <description>Quick introduction - this blog is aimed to keep track of our little adventures, show off our pictures and in the meantime, give you some tips we wish we knew beforehand. We are two Imperial students based in Windsor - one graduated from Maths &amp;amp; Computer Science, currently doctoring at Oxford; the other, graduated from Electrical and Electronic Engineering and now working as a Systems Engineer at Cisco. We have travelled as far as Hawaii and as close as Chiltern Hills.</description>

      <description>Leith Hill, at 294 m above sea level, is the highest point in Surrey and second highest in south-east England. Doesn’t sounds impressive? Well, it’s as high as the highest point in the whole of Lithuania! And higher than the highest ‘peaks’ in the Vatican (perhaps unsurprisingly), Monaco, Malta and Denmark! Jokes aside though, proximity to London and picturesque setting makes it for an excellent day trip from the capital. It’s easiest to reach by car, but train is an option too (Southern to Holmwood).</description>
