<p>Having recently visited and enjoyed Hampstead Heath (HH), we thought we&rsquo;d share some photos and give you, Londoners, TEN REASONS to go there yourself.</p>

<ol>
<li><h3 id="swimming">Swimming</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start with the thing you might already be aware of - Hampstead Heath boasts three swimming ponds (female, male and mixed), which are <strong>open all year round</strong> and <strong>basically free</strong> (you&rsquo;re supposed to pay, but no one bothers); they have <strong>lifeguards</strong> (well, does anyone care about that?), <strong>changing facilities</strong>, <strong>showers</strong> (hot for ladies, cold otherwise) and <strong>springboards </strong>for diving.</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_289&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;4608&rdquo;]<img src="https://macandwentravelling.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/p8040535.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" /> <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> for style, <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> for distance[/caption]</p>

<p><img src="https://macandwentravelling.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/p8040529.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" /></p></li>

<li><h3 id="free-food">Free food!</h3>

<p>In particular, wild berries growing in the foresty parts of the park. They&rsquo;re quite tasty too, as long as you like it sour.</p></li>

<li><h3 id="awesome-trees">Awesome trees</h3>

<p>There was this one article we read on the internet which ranked the best places for climbing in London: apart from the typical indoor climbing gyms such as Westway or The Castle, the list featured&hellip; trees in Hampstead Heath as 5th place! Now we know what they meant. Those trees seem to be made for climbing. They&rsquo;re so expansive and branchy, climbing them feels like ascending a ladder. And provides a nice adrenaline boost.</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_291&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;4608&rdquo;]<img src="https://macandwentravelling.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/p8040574.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" /> Where&rsquo;s Wally Maciek? (Hint: quite high)[/caption]</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_292&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;4608&rdquo;]<img src="https://macandwentravelling.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/p8040564.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" /> Even Wendy managed to climb a tree[/caption]</p>

<p><img src="https://macandwentravelling.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/p8040614.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" />Those trees are located mostly in central and west parts of the park.</p></li>

<li><h3 id="extensiveness">Extensiveness</h3>

<p>At 320 hectares, Hampstead Heath is not the largest green space in London, but it&rsquo;s up there (we don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a bigger park heath within the same distance to City of London). The big size means that you&rsquo;ll easily find a remote enough spot even on a hot, busy day. You can also go for a long walk/jog that doesn&rsquo;t visit the same spot twice. In fact, HH is regarded as the home of cross-country running in Britain.</p></li>

<li><h3 id="wilderness">Wilderness</h3>

<p>While south part of the park is mainly grassland, suitable for a picnic, ball game, frisbee or simply hanging out in a bigger group of people, as you proceed north, you encounter dense forest with various types of vegetation, plenty of old trees and deadwood.</p>

<p><img src="https://macandwentravelling.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/p8040595.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" /></p>

<p><img src="https://macandwentravelling.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/p8040603.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" /></p></li>

<li><h3 id="vistas">Vistas</h3>

<p>South part of the park features <strong>Parliament Hill</strong>, a sandy ridge that stretches from Hampstead on the west to Highgate on the east, reaches nearly 100m in height and is notable for its excellent views of <strong>London skyline</strong>, with Canary Wharf and City of London skyscrapers, St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, BT Tower and Emirates Stadium, among others, visible. What&rsquo;s more, parts of that panorama are <strong>protected</strong>, which means no buildings that would disturb that view are allowed to be built. <img src="https://macandwentravelling.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/p8040639.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" /></p>

<li><h3 id="gay-cruising">Gay cruising</h3>

<p>That&rsquo;s an exciting one. Gay cruising involves searching about a public place in pursuit of a partner for sex. West part of HH is regarded as one of the safest grounds in London for that activity. It&rsquo;s supposed to take place mostly at night, but even during the day, if you go astray in the woods, don&rsquo;t be surprised to see a gay couple making out, hidden in the bushes, or hustling after an intercourse that you&rsquo;ve interrupted. Allegedly, George Michael was once caught cruising at Hampstead Heath at 2am.</p></li>

<li><h3 id="you-can-throw-your-birthday-party-in-hh">You can throw your birthday party in HH</h3>

<p>How about celebrating your birthday in a park? If you&rsquo;re (un)lucky enough to be born in the summer: why not spend a day drinking beer, playing games, frying steaks and chatting to friends, all while enjoying great British weather, before hitting that club in the night? In our one-day visit, we saw at least 5 birthdays being celebrated around the area with pretty cool ideas such as stacking your can beers and converting it to a sword!</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_305&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;3456&rdquo;]<img src="https://macandwentravelling.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/p8040634.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" /> That&rsquo;s how Wendy is gonna celebrate her bday next year![/caption]</p></li>

<li><h3 id="no-tourists">No tourists</h3>

<p>Finally, unlike Hyde Park, Regent&rsquo;s Park, Green Park etc., HH is not too popular among tourists. So if you are a tourist, go there and get a taste of how the locals spend their free time, and if you&rsquo;re a Londoner, go there to escape from the bustling city and enjoy this <strong>oasis of serenity</strong>.</p></li>

<li><h3 id="it-s-in-london">It&rsquo;s in London</h3>

<p>Quite an obvious point, but worth stressing; if you live in the capital, you have no excuses for not visiting Hampstead Heath - it&rsquo;s right there, unlike other places we describe in the blog.</p>
